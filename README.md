What drive the price of a used car?

### Project Title: Exploring Drivers of Used Car Prices

**Ezra OcubaMichael**

#### Executive summary
This project explores the factors that affect used car prices and aims to provide insights to used car dealers in order to fine-tune their inventory. The study utilized a dataset of over 400,000 car listings, scraped from Craigslist, and employed regression analysis techniques to determine the key drivers of used car prices.



#### Rationale
Used car prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from the car's condition, mileage, year of manufacture, brand, and other features. Understanding the factors that affect used car prices is essential for used car dealers to optimize their inventory and pricing strategies. This study aims to provide insights to used car dealers and enable them to make data-driven decisions.


#### Research Question
What are the key drivers of used car prices?

#### Data Sources
The study used a dataset of over 400,000 car listings scraped from Craigslist. The dataset includes information on the car's make, model, year of manufacture, condition, mileage, price, and other features.

#### Methodology
the study employed regression analysis techniques to determine the key drivers of used car prices. Specifically, we utilized simple linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and decision tree regression to model the relationship between car prices and various features.

#### Results
Our analysis revealed that the year of manufacture, mileage, brand, and transmission type were the most significant drivers of used car prices. Other important factors include the car's condition, number of cylinders, and model. The decision tree regression model achieved the highest R-squared score of 0.67, indicating that it was the best model for predicting used car prices.


### Recommendations:
Based on our findings, we recommend that used car dealers focus on stocking cars with desirable features, such as newer models, low mileage, and popular brands. Dealers should also pay close attention to the condition of the car and its transmission type, as these features significantly affect prices. Additionally, dealers can use the decision tree regression model to predict prices and optimize their pricing strategies.
